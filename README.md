# Ecommerce

This is a simple eCommerce web app demo that allows users to add products to their cart. The app uses **Supabase** for user authentication and basic cart management. When a user adds a product to the cart, they are redirected to a login page (for demo purposes). The app also uses **ShadCN** for modern UI components.
